)

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing this brief cover letter for the recent job opening of Software Engineer at your R&D department in Gent, Belgium.

While scrolling through LinkedIn job applications, this one peaked my interest. After having enrolled in numerous Algorithms and telecommunication- and networking courses during my studies, this job opening seems to be a great follow up.

Not only have I studied theory during my studies, but I have also gathered a decent amount of experience solving problems and developing software, both alone and in group. Over the years I have also had the opportunity to be part of small to medium agile teams developing software as a Student Job and Internship. Combined with the occasinal personal side-project I can say that I have become pretty comfortable in the software engineering landscape and I am always keen to learn new things and improve on my skills.

What I am now primarily looking for, as I finialize my Master's Education, is a team to join and re-enforce, starting in the period of September to October.

I hope that I hereby have been able to convince you of my interest and intent and look forward to hearing from you for an eventual exploratory conversation!



Sincerely,
