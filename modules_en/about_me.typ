#cvSection("About Me")

Hi, I am a master student in Computer Science Engineering at the university of Ghent with a bachelor in Computer Science. I have an interest in developing correct, secure, and efficient software and I am on the lookout for new experiences!

I was born and raised at the lovely Belgian Coast, in Ostend. With the big sand beaches and North Sea becoming my second home. Now, after almost finishing my studies in the city of Ghent, I intend to move to Ghent where currently most of my activities take place.
